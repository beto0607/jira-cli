# Jira CLI

Scripts to handle tickets in Jira from my terminal

### Why?

I got tired of creating a branch, start working on it and realize that I never moved the ticket in Jira, needing to go back to my browser, open Jira and drag&drop. I'd much rather do it from my terminal.

After a first try with curl scripts, I decided to give it a try to do it in GoLang.
Some inspiration came from [gh cli](https://github.com/cli/cli)

### Build&Install

#### Requires:

* [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) version 1.23

#### Build

* `make build`

#### Install

* `make install`

### Configs

This tool expects a file in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jira-cli/config.conf` (or `~/.config/jira-cli/config.conf` if `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set)

``` launguage: conf
[auth]
    token = "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
[user]
    accountId = "<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>"
    email = "your@email.com"
[jira]
    organization = "<YOUR_ORGANIZATION>"
[fzf]
    enabled = "<on |off>"
[alias]
    test = "transition -g -s"
```

Use `jira-cli config set ...` for updating your configurations

### FZF

You can use [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) for searching, for example, transitions or assignees. If disabled, it will use some custom prompting.

Enable by running `jira-cli config set fzf.enabled on`.
